## Feature list
1. able to enter and search for useful information through an API get
2. able to reflect the useful information in a humanely readable format
3. able to enter and save entries based on user inputs
4. used apexcharts for charts
5. used local storage instead of a database to store and retain information
6. able to reload and calculate values based on user inputs
7. more chart filters

## Bugs
1. thousand seperator only works when there is an initial value at the start.
2. api is limited to a certain number of calls per day 
3. local storage saving value as blanks will crash the system 

## Yet to implement
1. a login page with authentication for user to enter and store their data
2. a database to store user data.
3. a script to access stored user data to use sentiment analysis on stocks/ trades/ 
4. a script to search for the most common stock symbols
5. a beautiful calander UI/UX that allows user to access data entered by daily
6. a calander that sums up the P/L of trades made in a day/week
7. a stats that return insight on a user habits such as best day of the week to trade/ worst day of the week to trade/ worst month, etc...
8. a summary and keynotes of indicators to look out for
9. an automatic comparision of simmilar stocks in the same sector/industry on their income statement/balance sheet
10. a page where you can store multiple watchlists and see live updates on their prices
11. a page where you can find how companies are related to each other
e.g. Mergers, rumors, acquistions, deals, servicer provider to supply (Electrical Vehicles and Electrical Vehicles Lithumn Battery)
12. autocomplete in search bar

## Visual Design
1. after comparing with similar sites like yahoo finance, investing.com, seeking alpha, a plain background is a good decision to not strain the eyes
2. mobile responsiveness is designed through mobile design first.

## Testing steps
### Chart 
1. check api call and data is usable
2. format chart data datetime to EPOCH format that apexcharts require
3. reorder chart data to oldest to newest instead of newest to oldest for chart to display in the right chronological order
4. ensure that render chart data is deleted else chart will display previous search data


### Stats page
1. test the local storage inputs
2. ensure that the html is not overwritten and persist for color change to work
3. ensure thousand seperator is not an return an empty element
